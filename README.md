# qtrocket
Model Rocket Simulator written in C++ and Qt Toolkit

QtRocket is still in the very early stages of development, and not suitable for any real use. It currently calculates the trajectory of a cannonball with the effects of air resistance. Some of the basic architecture is coming together, but the current implementation is only mature enough to create a cannonball and launch it.

This is also an experiment and learning platform for me to learn Qt GUI programming, so if it is non-standard or very strange to experienced Qt programmers, that's why.

Another feature is the use of ANSI standard C++17 for the bulk of the application. Qt specific features are limited to the GUI.
